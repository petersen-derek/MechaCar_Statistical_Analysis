Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 - Intercept, Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance provided non-random amounts of variance.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 - No, the P-value is significantly lower than 0.05.  

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 - Depends on what one determines to be effective.  The r-squared value of 0.71 indicates that ~70% of the variablity can be explained by the model.  So while it covers more of the data than not- it still could be better.
